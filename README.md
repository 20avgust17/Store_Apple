This internet store is built using the Python Django web framework, the Django Rest Framework for creating APIs, PostgreSQL as the database management system, Celery for background task processing, and Redis for caching and message brokering. Additionally, the Allauth library is used for user authentication and the Stripe library is used for handling payments. Google Capcha is used for security purpose. With these technologies, the store is able to handle high traffic and provide a smooth user experience for browsing and purchasing products.
